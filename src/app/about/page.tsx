          Iâ€™m a multi-disciplinary developer with a passion for creating beautiful,
          functional web applications. My interests span front-end development,
          UX design, and emerging technologies.

        <p className="leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
          Outside of coding, you might find me exploring new art exhibitions,
          hiking scenic trails, or experimenting with creative coding and
          generative art projects.
